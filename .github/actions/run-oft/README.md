Runs OpenFastTrace CLI's `trace` command on the local workspace and uploads the report as a workflow artifact.

Considers all (relevant) specification documents from the `up-spec` submodule and all
implementation and documentation artifacts contained in the local repository.

The action uses the [standard OpenFastTrace Action](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace-github-action) for running OpenFastTrace (OFT).
